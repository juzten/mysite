<h1>My Life In Tech</h1>
<p>
<b>Woot Woot!! First post using jekyll </b>
<br><br>
This is my first post to this site and hopefully there will be a zillion to follow it. I am going to start writing about my life experiences. Whatever it may be such as technology, life, the world, what I have done, what I want to do , or just whatever I am thinking about at the moment. I want it to be a way for me to express myself, a way for me to build relationships with other people, a way to promote myself, a way to learn about myself, and a way for me to learn about other things. My interest in things are constantly changing from day to day, I have many hobbies and the list of them keep growing as time passes. I plan on writing at least one post each week but as life happens we will see how that goes. 
<br>
<br>
Subjects that I might talk about:<br>
Computers, programming, web design,
more specificly my journey in technology, what I learn about, how I do things, what I use, and what I think. <br><br>
Currently my code interest are:
Python, django, drupal, web design with fancy css and jquery, responsive design, jekyll, android, and adjusting my coding workflow. 
<br><br>
	
This site will be my playground to try out new ideas, write about my experiences and the many projects that I take on, all while being the holding tank for my life in tech. I hope my adventures become a resource for others to expand their knowledge with as well.
